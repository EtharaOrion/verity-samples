# Detached signature over the canonical payload. UNSIGNED.
#
# Item 10i requires an external signature naming a signer and verifying against an outside trust
# root. No signer exists: seed/pilot.yaml records that the workflow holding the private half does
# not exist. This file records what would be signed and states plainly that nothing signed it, so
# the absence is resolvable from the delivered unit rather than inferred from a missing file.
# Without a valid signature the producer claim is not authenticated and the bundle caps at
# HOLD:PILOT_REQUIRED, which is where the shakedown ceiling already sits.
